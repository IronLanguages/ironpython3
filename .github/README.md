**IronPython** is a popular, open-source implementation of Python 3.x for .NET that is built on top of its very own [Dynamic Language Runtime](https://github.com/IronLanguages/dlr).

> [!NOTE]
> There is still much that needs to be done to support Python 3. We are working on it, albeit slowly.
> We welcome all those who would like to help! ‚ù§Ô∏è

IronPython is an open-source implementation of the Python programming language that is tightly integrated with .NET. IronPython can use .NET and Python libraries, and other .NET languages can use Python code just as easily.

IronPython 3 targets Python 3, including the re-organized standard library, Unicode strings, and all of the other new features.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Examples

The following C# program:

```cs
using System.Windows.Forms;

MessageBox.Show("Hello World!", "Greetings", MessageBoxButtons.OKCancel);
```

can be written in IronPython as follows:

```py
import clr
clr.AddReference("System.Windows.Forms")
from System.Windows.Forms import MessageBox, MessageBoxButtons

MessageBox.Show("Hello World!", "Greetings", MessageBoxButtons.OKCancel)
```

Here is an example how to call Python code from a C# program.

```cs
var eng = IronPython.Hosting.Python.CreateEngine();
var scope = eng.CreateScope();
eng.Execute(@"
def greetings(name):
    return 'Hello ' + name.title() + '!'
", scope);
dynamic greetings = scope.GetVariable("greetings");
System.Console.WriteLine(greetings("world"));
```

> This example assumes that `IronPython` has been added to the C# project as a NuGet package.

- [`Python3.0`](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/WhatsNew%E2%80%90Python3.0)
- [`Python3.1`](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/WhatsNew%E2%80%90Python3.1)
- [`Python3.2`](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/WhatsNew%E2%80%90Python3.2)
- [`Python3.3`](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/WhatsNew%E2%80%90Python3.3)
- [`Python3.4`](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/WhatsNew%E2%80%90Python3.4)
- [`Python3.5`](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/WhatsNew%E2%80%90Python3.5)
- [`Python3.6`](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/WhatsNew%E2%80%90Python3.6)

## üôã Contributing
For details on contributing see the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) article.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgrading from IronPython 2
For details on upgrading from IronPython 2 to 3 see the [Upgrading from IronPython 2 to 3](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/Upgrading-from-IronPython2) article.

## üß≠ Differences with CPython
While compatibility with CPython is one of our main goals with IronPython 3, there are still some differences that may cause issues. See [Differences from CPython](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/Differences-from-CPython) for details.

## üì¶ Package compatibility
See the [Package compatibility](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/Package-compatibility) document for information on compatibility with popular packages.

## üéÅ Installation
Binaries of IronPython 3 can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/releases/latest), available in various formats: `.msi`, `.zip`, `.deb`, `.pkg`. The IronPython package is also available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPython/3.4.0). See the [installation document](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/Installing) for detailed instructions on how to install a standalone IronPython interpreter on various operating systems and .NET frameworks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build
See the [building document](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/wiki/Building). Since the main development is on Windows, bugs on other platforms may inadvertently be introduced - please report them!

## Supported Platforms
IronPython 3 targets .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 6.0. The support for .NET and .NET Core follow the lifecycle defined on [.NET and .NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).
