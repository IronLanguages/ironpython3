IronPython Console
==================

IronPython is an open-source implementation of the Python programming language that is tightly integrated with the .NET Framework. IronPython can use the .NET Framework and Python libraries, and other .NET languages can use Python code just as easily.

This package contains a standalone Python interpreter running on .NET Framework, invokable from the command line as `ipy`. It also includes the Python Standard Library released by the Python project, but slightly modified to work better with IronPython and .NET.

The current target is Python 3.4, although features and behaviors from later versions may be included. Refer to the [source code repository](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3) for list of features from each version of CPython that have been implemented.


## Differences with CPython
While compatibility with CPython is one of our main goals with IronPython 3, there are still some differences that may cause issues. See [Differences from CPython](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/blob/main/docs/differences-from-c-python.md) for details.

## Package compatibility
See the [Package compatibility](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/blob/main/docs/package-compatibility.md) document for information on compatibility with popular Python packages.
