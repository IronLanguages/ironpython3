# `eng`

This directory contains MSBuild targets and project property files for building the app on different configurations that are consumed by the main `Build.proj` file in the root directory as well as the `make.ps1` script used to build the binaries in bulk.
This directory also contains packaging targets, exactly the same as the .NET Runtime repo.
