IronPython 3.4.0-alpha1 Released
================================

On behalf of the IronPython team, I'm very happy to announce the release of [IronPython 3.4.0-alpha1](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/releases/tag/v3.4.0-alpha1). The runtime targets are .NET Framework 4.6, .NET Core 2.1, .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5. The baseline for this release is Python 3.4.

IronPython 3.4 uses Python 3.4 syntax and standard libraries and so your Python code will need to be updated accordingly. For details on upgrading from IronPython 2 to 3 see the [Upgrading from IronPython 2 to 3](Documentation/upgrading-from-ipy2.md) article.

While compatibility with CPython has been one of our main goals with IronPython 3, there are still some differences that may cause issues, for more information see the [Differences from CPython](Documentation/differences-from-c-python.md) article.
