    **
    ** This file implements a external (disk-based) database using BTrees.
    ** For a detailed discussion of BTrees, refer to
    **
    **     Donald E. Knuth, THE ART OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, Volume 3:
    **     "Sorting And Searching", pages 473-480. Addison-Wesley
    **     Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts.
    **
    ** The basic idea is that each page of the file contains N database
    ** entries and N+1 pointers to subpages.
    **
    **   ----------------------------------------------------------------
    **   |  Ptr(0) | Key(0) | Ptr(1) | Key(1) | ... | Key(N-1) | Ptr(N) |
    **   ----------------------------------------------------------------
    **
    ** All of the keys on the page that Ptr(0) points to have values less
    ** than Key(0).  All of the keys on page Ptr(1) and its subpages have
    ** values greater than Key(0) and less than Key(1).  All of the keys
    ** on Ptr(N) and its subpages have values greater than Key(N-1).  And
    ** so forth.
    **
    ** Finding a particular key requires reading O(log(M)) pages from the
    ** disk where M is the number of entries in the tree.
    **
    ** In this implementation, a single file can hold one or more separate
    ** BTrees.  Each BTree is identified by the index of its root page.  The
    ** key and data for any entry are combined to form the "payload".  A
    ** fixed amount of payload can be carried directly on the database
    ** page.  If the payload is larger than the preset amount then surplus
    ** bytes are stored on overflow pages.  The payload for an entry
    ** and the preceding pointer are combined to form a "Cell".  Each
    ** page has a small header which contains the Ptr(N) pointer and other
    ** information such as the size of key and data.
    **
    ** FORMAT DETAILS
    **
    ** The file is divided into pages.  The first page is called page 1,
    ** the second is page 2, and so forth.  A page number of zero indicates
    ** "no such page".  The page size can be any power of 2 between 512 and 65536.
    ** Each page can be either a btree page, a freelist page, an overflow
    ** page, or a pointer-map page.
    **
    ** The first page is always a btree page.  The first 100 bytes of the first
    ** page contain a special header (the "file header") that describes the file.
    ** The format of the file header is as follows:
    **
    **   OFFSET   SIZE    DESCRIPTION
    **      0      16     Header string: "SQLite format 3\000"
    **     16       2     Page size in bytes.
    **     18       1     File format write version
    **     19       1     File format read version
    **     20       1     Bytes of unused space at the end of each page
    **     21       1     Max embedded payload fraction
    **     22       1     Min embedded payload fraction
    **     23       1     Min leaf payload fraction
    **     24       4     File change counter
    **     28       4     Reserved for future use
    **     32       4     First freelist page
    **     36       4     Number of freelist pages in the file
    **     40      60     15 4-byte meta values passed to higher layers
    **
    **     40       4     Schema cookie
    **     44       4     File format of schema layer
    **     48       4     Size of page cache
    **     52       4     Largest root-page (auto/incr_vacuum)
    **     56       4     1=UTF-8 2=UTF16le 3=UTF16be
    **     60       4     User version
    **     64       4     Incremental vacuum mode
    **     68       4     unused
    **     72       4     unused
    **     76       4     unused
    **
    ** All of the integer values are big-endian (most significant byte first).
    **
    ** The file change counter is incremented when the database is changed
    ** This counter allows other processes to know when the file has changed
    ** and thus when they need to flush their cache.
    **
    ** The max embedded payload fraction is the amount of the total usable
    ** space in a page that can be consumed by a single cell for standard
    ** B-tree (non-LEAFDATA) tables.  A value of 255 means 100%.  The default
    ** is to limit the maximum cell size so that at least 4 cells will fit
    ** on one page.  Thus the default max embedded payload fraction is 64.
    **
    ** If the payload for a cell is larger than the max payload, then extra
    ** payload is spilled to overflow pages.  Once an overflow page is allocated,
    ** as many bytes as possible are moved into the overflow pages without letting
    ** the cell size drop below the min embedded payload fraction.
    **
    ** The min leaf payload fraction is like the min embedded payload fraction
    ** except that it applies to leaf nodes in a LEAFDATA tree.  The maximum
    ** payload fraction for a LEAFDATA tree is always 100% (or 255) and it
    ** not specified in the header.
    **
    ** Each btree pages is divided into three sections:  The header, the
    ** cell pointer array, and the cell content area.  Page 1 also has a 100-byte
    ** file header that occurs before the page header.
    **
    **      |----------------|
    **      | file header    |   100 bytes.  Page 1 only.
    **      |----------------|
    **      | page header    |   8 bytes for leaves.  12 bytes for interior nodes
    **      |----------------|
    **      | cell pointer   |   |  2 bytes per cell.  Sorted order.
    **      | array          |   |  Grows downward
    **      |                |   v
    **      |----------------|
    **      | unallocated    |
    **      | space          |
    **      |----------------|   ^  Grows upwards
    **      | cell content   |   |  Arbitrary order interspersed with freeblocks.
    **      | area           |   |  and free space fragments.
    **      |----------------|
    **
    ** The page headers looks like this:
    **
    **   OFFSET   SIZE     DESCRIPTION
    **      0       1      Flags. 1: intkey, 2: zerodata, 4: leafdata, 8: leaf
    **      1       2      byte offset to the first freeblock
    **      3       2      number of cells on this page
    **      5       2      first byte of the cell content area
    **      7       1      number of fragmented free bytes
    **      8       4      Right child (the Ptr(N) value).  Omitted on leaves.
    **
    ** The flags define the format of this btree page.  The leaf flag means that
    ** this page has no children.  The zerodata flag means that this page carries
    ** only keys and no data.  The intkey flag means that the key is a integer
    ** which is stored in the key size entry of the cell header rather than in
    ** the payload area.
    **
    ** The cell pointer array begins on the first byte after the page header.
    ** The cell pointer array contains zero or more 2-byte numbers which are
    ** offsets from the beginning of the page to the cell content in the cell
    ** content area.  The cell pointers occur in sorted order.  The system strives
    ** to keep free space after the last cell pointer so that new cells can
    ** be easily added without having to defragment the page.
    **
    ** Cell content is stored at the very end of the page and grows toward the
    ** beginning of the page.
    **
    ** Unused space within the cell content area is collected into a linked list of
    ** freeblocks.  Each freeblock is at least 4 bytes in size.  The byte offset
    ** to the first freeblock is given in the header.  Freeblocks occur in
    ** increasing order.  Because a freeblock must be at least 4 bytes in size,
    ** any group of 3 or fewer unused bytes in the cell content area cannot
    ** exist on the freeblock chain.  A group of 3 or fewer free bytes is called
    ** a fragment.  The total number of bytes in all fragments is recorded.
    ** in the page header at offset 7.
    **
    **    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
    **      2     Byte offset of the next freeblock
    **      2     Bytes in this freeblock
    **
    ** Cells are of variable length.  Cells are stored in the cell content area at
    ** the end of the page.  Pointers to the cells are in the cell pointer array
    ** that immediately follows the page header.  Cells is not necessarily
    ** contiguous or in order, but cell pointers are contiguous and in order.
    **
    ** Cell content makes use of variable length integers.  A variable
    ** length integer is 1 to 9 bytes where the lower 7 bits of each
    ** byte are used.  The integer consists of all bytes that have bit 8 set and
    ** the first byte with bit 8 clear.  The most significant byte of the integer
    ** appears first.  A variable-length integer may not be more than 9 bytes long.
    ** As a special case, all 8 bytes of the 9th byte are used as data.  This
    ** allows a 64-bit integer to be encoded in 9 bytes.
    **
    **    0x00                      becomes  0x00000000
    **    0x7f                      becomes  0x0000007f
    **    0x81 0x00                 becomes  0x00000080
    **    0x82 0x00                 becomes  0x00000100
    **    0x80 0x7f                 becomes  0x0000007f
    **    0x8a 0x91 0xd1 0xac 0x78  becomes  0x12345678
    **    0x81 0x81 0x81 0x81 0x01  becomes  0x10204081
    **
    ** Variable length integers are used for rowids and to hold the number of
    ** bytes of key and data in a btree cell.
    **
    ** The content of a cell looks like this:
    **
    **    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
    **      4     Page number of the left child. Omitted if leaf flag is set.
    **     var    Number of bytes of data. Omitted if the zerodata flag is set.
    **     var    Number of bytes of key. Or the key itself if intkey flag is set.
    **      *     Payload
    **      4     First page of the overflow chain.  Omitted if no overflow
    **
    ** Overflow pages form a linked list.  Each page except the last is completely
    ** filled with data (pagesize - 4 bytes).  The last page can have as little
    ** as 1 byte of data.
    **
    **    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
    **      4     Page number of next overflow page
    **      *     Data
    **
    ** Freelist pages come in two subtypes: trunk pages and leaf pages.  The
    ** file header points to the first in a linked list of trunk page.  Each trunk
    ** page points to multiple leaf pages.  The content of a leaf page is
    ** unspecified.  A trunk page looks like this:
    **
    **    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
    **      4     Page number of next trunk page
    **      4     Number of leaf pointers on this page
    **      *     zero or more pages numbers of leaves

    ** or more database connections.  When two or more connections are
    ** sharing the same database file, each connection has it own
    ** private Btree object for the file and each of those Btrees points
    ** to this one BtShared object.  BtShared.nRef is the number of
    ** connections currently sharing this database file.
    **
    ** Fields in this structure are accessed under the BtShared.mutex
    ** mutex, except for nRef and pNext which are accessed under the
    ** global SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER mutex.  The pPager field
    ** may not be modified once it is initially set as long as nRef>0.
    ** The pSchema field may be set once under BtShared.mutex and
    ** thereafter is unchanged as long as nRef>0.
    **
    ** isPending:
    **
    **   If a BtShared client fails to obtain a write-lock on a database
    **   table (because there exists one or more read-locks on the table),
    **   the shared-cache enters 'pending-lock' state and isPending is
    **   set to true.
    **
    **   The shared-cache leaves the 'pending lock' state when either of
    **   the following occur:
    **
    **     1) The current writer (BtShared.pWriter) concludes its transaction, OR
    **     2) The number of locks held by other connections drops to zero.
    **
    **   while in the 'pending-lock' state, no connection may start a new
    **   transaction.
    **
    **   This feature is included to help prevent writer-starvation.
